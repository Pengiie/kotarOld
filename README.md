# kotarOld
Made with ambition to support 3d game development with an editor. Instead I focused too much on progression on the engine (Which isn't a bad thing, kept me motivated), and instead I should've focused more on the foundational aspects of the engine.

I will be recreating this engine with a cleaner API with a focus on the engine part with 2d, then I will work on an editor after a majority is done first. The name will stay the same, "kotaro", which is why this project is now called kotarOld.
