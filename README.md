# kotarOld
Made with ambition to support 3d game development with an editor. Instead I focused too much on progression on the engine (Which isn't a bad thing, kept me motivated), and instead I should've focused more on the foundational aspects of the engine.

I will be recreating this engine with a cleaner API with a focus on the engine part with 2d, then I will work on an editor after a majority is done first. The name will stay the same, "kotaro", which is why this project is now called kotarOld.

A good amount of the new engine will reuse code from this engine, though with more tidying. I also want to focus on the multiplatform aspect and create a nice DSL for creating UIs. I also want to somehow include DirectX 11 in this project too with the native compilation with Kotlin/Native. I also want to work to make this compile with WebGL. Would also like to try out Vulkan too. I then want to address the editor with a clean interface to create levels and games.
